// Comparison Operators

// sometimes we need to use different types of operators to compare values. These operators are called comparison operators.

// Less than: <
// Greater than: >
// Less than or equal to: <=
// Greater than or equal to: >=
// Is equal to: ===
// Is not equal to: !==

// Comparison operators compare the value on the left with the value on the right.

10 < 12 // Evaluates to true

// We can also use comparison operators on different data types like strings:

'apples' === 'oranges' // false

// All comparison statements evaluate to either true or false and are made up of:
//Two values that will be compared.
// An operator that separates the values and compares them accordingly (>, <, <=,>=,===,!==).

// declear a variable
let hungerLevel = 7;
if (hungerLevel > 7) { // use if statement
  console.log('Time to eat!')
} else { // will execute else statement
  console.log('We can eat later!');
};
let number = 323; // declear variable
let string = 'computer'; // declear second variable
if (number >= string) { // use if...else statements
  console.log('It\'s true!');
} else {
  console.log('It\'s false!'); // log It's false!
}

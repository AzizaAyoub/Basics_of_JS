// The console is a panel that displays important messages, like errors, for developers.

// One action, or method, that is built into the console object is the .log() method.

console.log('My name is Aziza'); // My name is Aziza
console.log(19); // output 19
console.log(15); // output 15



// Comments

// Comments can explain what the code is doing, leave instructions for developers using the code, or add any other useful annotations.

// There are two types of code comments in JavaScript:

// A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes // preceding it.

// like this
// Prints 5 to the console
// console.log(5);
 
 
// A multi-line comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment, and */ to end the comment.like 



/*
This is all commented 
console.log(10);
None of this is going to run!
console.log(99);
*/


// You can also use this syntax to comment something out in the middle of a line of code:

console.log(/*IGNORED!*/ 5);  // Still just prints 5

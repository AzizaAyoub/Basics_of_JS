// Destructured Assignment

// We often want to extract key-value pairs from objects and save them as variables.

// Take for example the following object:

const vampire = {
  name: 'Dracula',
  residence: 'Transylvania',
  preferences: {
    day: 'stay inside',
    night: 'satisfy appetite'
  }
};

// If we wanted to extract the residence property as a variable, we could use the following code:

const residence = vampire.residence; 
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania' 


// In destructured assignment we create a variable with the name of an objectâ€™s key that is wrapped in curly braces { } and assign to it the object. Take a look at the example below:

const { residence } = vampire;
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania'


// We can even use destructured assignment to grab nested properties of an object:

const { day } = vampire.preferences; 
console.log(day); // Prints 'stay inside'

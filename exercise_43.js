// The While Loop

// A for loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
for (let counterOne = 1; counterOne < 4; counterOne++){
  console.log(counterOne);
}

// A while loop that prints 1, 2, and 3
let counterTwo = 1;
while (counterTwo < 4) {
  console.log(counterTwo);
  counterTwo++;
}

// The syntax of a while loop is ideal when we donâ€™t know in advance how many times the loop should run.
// In situations when we want a loop to execute an undetermined number of times, while loops are the best choice.

const cards = ['diamond', 'spade', 'heart', 'club'];

// Write your code below
let currentCard;
while (currentCard !== 'spade') {
  currentCard = cards[Math.floor(Math.random() * 4)];
  console.log(currentCard);
}

 // In programming, we also perform a task based on a condition using an if statement:

if (true) {
  console.log('This message will print!');
}
// Prints: This message will print!

// we have an if statement. The if statement is composed of:

/*
The if keyword followed by a set of parentheses () which is followed by a block statement, indicated by a set of curly braces {}.

Inside the parentheses (), a condition is provided that evaluates to true or false.

If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the curly braces {} runs, or executes.
If the condition evaluates to false, the block wonâ€™t execute.
